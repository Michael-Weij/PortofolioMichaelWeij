ABSTRACT = {Building operation data are important for monitoring, analysis, modeling, and control of building energy systems. However, missing data is one of the major data quality issues, making data imputation techniques become increasingly important. There are two key research gaps for missing sensor data imputation in buildings: the lack of customized and automated imputation methodology, and the difficulty of the validation of data imputation methods. In this paper, a framework is developed to address these two gaps. First, a validation data generation module is developed based on pattern recognition to create a validation dataset to quantify the performance of data imputation methods. Second, a pool of data imputation methods is tested under the validation dataset to find an optimal single imputation method for each sensor, which is termed as an ensemble method. The method can reflect the specific mechanism and randomness of missing data from each sensor. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated by 18 sensors from a real campus building. The overall accuracy of data imputation for those sensors improves by 18.2\% on average compared with the best single data imputation method.},

 abstract = {We consider intent-to-treat (IT) analysis of clinical trials involving longitudinal data subject to drop-out. Common methods, such as Last Observation Carried Forward imputation or incomplete-data methods based on models that assume random dropout, have serious drawbacks in the IT setting. We propose a method that involves multiple imputation of the missing values following drop-out based on an "as treated" model, using actual dose after drop-out if this is known, or imputed doses that incorporate a variety of plausible alternative assumptions if unknown. The multiply-imputed data sets are then analyzed using IT methods, where subjects are classified by randomization group rather than by the dose actually received. Results from the multiply-imputed data sets are combined using the methods of Rubin (1987, Multiple Imputation for Nonresponse in Surveys). A novel feature of the proposed method is that the models for imputation differ from the model used for the analysis of the filled-in data. The method is applied to data on a clinical trial for Tacrine in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {Improving the energy efficiency of the buildings is a worldwide hot topic nowadays. To assist comprehensive analysis and smart management, high-quality historical data records of the energy consumption is one of the key bases. However, the energy data records in the real world always contain different kinds of problems. The most common problem is missing data. It is also one of the most frequently reported data quality problems in big data/machine learning/deep learning related literature in energy management. However, limited studied have been conducted to comprehensively discuss different kinds of missing data situations, including random missing, continuous missing, and large proportionally missing. Also, the methods used in previous literature often rely on linear statistical methods or traditional machine learning methods. Limited study has explored the feasibility of advanced deep learning and transfer learning techniques in this problem. To this end, this study proposed a methodology, namely the hybrid Long Short Term Memory model with Bi-directional Imputation and Transfer Learning (LSTM-BIT). It integrates the powerful modeling ability of deep learning networks and flexible transferability of transfer learning. A case study on the electric consumption data of a campus lab building was utilized to test the method. Results show that LSTM-BIT outperforms other methods with 4.24\% to 47.15\% lower RMSE under different missing rates.}
